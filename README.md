## Research Question: Is there a correlation between bot types and their country of origin, time of attack, and duration of attack?
- Three containers with identical framework, each assigned a different ip address
- Within each container a file structure was created in which PII was hidden at the deepest level to track attacker's interest and determination in accessing the PII
- Utilized chi squared test to determine if there was a significant relation between bot type and their, country of origin, time of attack, and duration of attack
## Results
